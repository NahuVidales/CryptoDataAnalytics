Like other cryptocurrencies, Ripple is built atop the idea of a distributed ledger network which requires various parties to participate in validating transactions, rather than any singular centralized authority.

It holds 55 billion XRP in an escrow account, which allows it to sell up to a billion per month if it so chooses in order to fund new projects and acquisitions.

    "ja": "Rippleは、Cryptocurrencyプラットフォームのキャッチオール名であり、トランザクションプロトコルは実際にはXRPで、EthereumはEtherでの取引を容易にするプラットフォームの名前です。他の暗号化通貨と同様に、Rippleは、分散元帳ネットワークの考え方の上に構築されており、様々な当事者が単一の集中管理機関ではなくトランザクションの検証に参加する必要があります。これは世界中の取引を容易にし、振込手数料はビットコインのようなものよりはるかに安いです。他の暗号化通貨とは異なり、XRP転送は実質的に即時であり、典型的な確認時間を必要としません。\r\n\r\nRippleはもともとは単一の会社Ripple Labsによって設立されたもので、Bitcoinの開発を継続する大規模な開発者ネットワークではなく、引き続きサポートされています。また、現存する通貨の変動額もありません。ビットコインが絶え間なく成長するプールを持ち、エテリアムには理論的に限界がないため、Rippleはゲートから100億XRPのトークンをすべて使用して作成されました。その数字は採掘なしで維持されており、トークンの大部分はRipple Labs自身が所有し保持しています。\r\n\r\n最近XRPあたり約50ドルの値下げがあったとしても、Ripple Labsは現在、約200億ドル相当の暗号侵害を抱えています（注：Rippleの価格は最近急落しており、これを読む）。エスクロー口座に550億のXRPを保有しているため、新規プロジェクトや買収に資金を提供するために選択すれば、月額10億ドルまで売却することができます。そのような量を売ることは、暗号侵害の価値に大きな影響を及ぼす可能性が高く、Ripple Labsがすぐに計画しているものではありません。\r\n\r\n実際、Ripple LabsはXRPの背後にあるテクノロジーを活用して、世界中の銀行取引をより迅速に行うことを検討しています。ビットコインや他の暗号化通貨は、金融取引を伝統的な通貨の金融機関から切り離すという考えに基づいて作られていますが、リップルはあらゆる意味でほぼ反対です。",

    "ko": "리플코인은 금융 거래를 위한 인터넷 프로토콜인 ‘리플 프로토콜’에서 사용되는 디지털 자산이자 기초 화폐입니다. 이 코인을 매개로 전 세계의 화폐를 몇 초 내로 송금할 수 있어 혁신적인 실시간 통화 거래가 가능합니다. '리플 프로토콜'이란 분산원장을 기반으로 한 ‘실시간 총액결제 시스템(RTS)’으로 국제결제시스템망(SWIFT)을 대체할 새로운 대안으로 주목받고 있습니다.\r\n\r\n송금 시스템에 가까운 특성이 있어 일반적인 가상화폐와는 그 구조가 다릅니다. 사용하는 합의 프로토콜도 독자적일 뿐만 아니라, 다른 코인들과 다르게 현실적으로 주도권의 집중화가 있기 때문입니다. 따라서 리플의 시스템은 한정된 참여자만 분산 네트워크를 구성한다는 의미에서 프라이빗 블록체인(private blockchain)이라고 불리기도 합니다. \r\n\r\n리플사는 총량의 62%의 코인을 보유하고 있으며, 사업 개발 단계에 따라 전략적으로 시장에 유통하고 있습니다. 리플사는 그들이 전체 유통의 반수 이상으로 보유하고 있는 코인을 악용할 우려를 잠재우기 위해 암호화를 통해 보호된 조건부 날인 계정(escrow)에 리플을 넣어둔다고 합니다.\r\n\r\n코인 특징\r\n1. 현재 주로 은행 간 이체서비스에 집중하여 진행 중이며, 리플 네트워크에는 미쓰비시 도쿄UFJ 은행, 스웨덴 SEB, 중동의 아부다비 국립은행과 인도 Axis 은행을 비롯한 세계 주요 금융권 75개가 참여하고 있습니다. 매년 빠른 속도로 확장하고 있으며, 최근 이들의 적극적인 참여로 상호 송금 거래 규모는 하루 7700만 달러를 넘어섰습니다.\r\n\r\n2. 리플은 연결 통화(bridge currency)로 역할 하므로 기존 통화시장과 달리 수요가 적은 희귀통화를 거래하기 쉽습니다. 복잡한 거래 과정이 불필요하고, 추가적인 비용도 지출되지 않기 때문입니다. \r\n\r\n3. 거래마다 0.0004달러의 수수료를 지급합니다. 이는 네트워크 스팸 공격을 막기 위한 것이며, 매우 적은 액수이므로 기존의 결제시스템보다 비교우위에 있습니다. 또한, 이 수수료는 영원히 소멸하게 되는데, 이는 시간이 지날수록 토큰의 가치가 조금씩 높아짐을 의미합니다. \r\n\r\n4. 인플레이션이 없습니다. 시간이 지날수록 화폐 총량이 늘어나는 대부분 가상화폐와 달리, 리플은 초기에 총 1천억 개 발행되었고 이제 더 추가로 생성되지 않기 때문입니다.\r\n\r\n핵심 가치\r\n(키워드: 환전/송금 거래에 P2P 네트워크의 적용)\r\n\r\nP2P 네트워크는 서로 모르는 사람 혹은 은행 간의 외환 거래를 중개하는 다리를 만들어 줍니다. 따라서 SWIFT와 같은 중개기관이 필요하지 않아 저렴한 비용으로 신속한 국제 결제 서비스를 가능하게 합니다.\r\n\r\n1. 결제 비용 감소: 중개기관을 거치지 않으므로 수수료를 절약 가능합니다. 특히 환전 시 달러 거래와 달리 은행 계좌를 요구하지 않기 때문에 서비스 수수료나 추가 운용 비용이 발생하지 않습니다. 따라서 리플은 기존 환율보다 훨씬 더 경쟁력 있는 외환 가격을 제공합니다. \r\n\r\n2. 실시간 결제: 전 세계 어디든 거래당 4초가 걸리며 즉각적인 정산이 가능합니다. XRP는 연중무휴로 초당 50,000건의 거래를 처리합니다.",
