The Intel Exchange allows anyone to buy and sell address labels and other intelligence, either through bounties, auctions or the DATA Program.\r\n\r\nUnlike many other platforms that focus on specific blockchains or limited data sources, Arkham aims to provide total coverage of the blockchain by collecting and aggregating data from various chains. This is done leveraging its proprietary AI system, ULTRA. It allows users to analyze and gain insights from a comprehensive view of the crypto ecosystem.\r\n\r\n The Arkham Intel Exchange is a decentralized marketplace where users can buy and sell crypto intelligence using the native currency, ARKM. This unique feature enables individuals and organizations to monetize their intelligence by offering bounties and conducting auctions. The exchange connects buyers and sellers, fostering a vibrant community of on-chain sleuths and ensuring the availability of valuable intelligence for market participants.\r\n\r\nArkham Intelligence was founded by Miguel Morel in 2020.
